socket assignment
========================

the node version
-------------------------
run the javascript one with node.js
set it up with :

cd socketassignment
npm install
```
then run it with
```
npm start
```

the java version
---------------------------
sorry, they made me do this.
I hate java. 

run the java one, by first compiling it with for example javac:

```
then run it with java
```
java client.class
```
